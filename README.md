My professional career started with 11 years of a steady movement from PHP Full Stack Developer towards Operations Engineer with a strong focus on LAMP/LEMP software stack. After these years I finally switched to the DevOps position in 2019 and keep advancing in that direction.

Right now I primarily speciaze in dockerizing microservices and setting up CI/CD processes for microserice-based web apps. 

Interested in a collaboration as a Golang Developer / Middle DevOps Engineer
