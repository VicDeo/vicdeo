After 11 years of a steady movement from PHP Fullstack developer towards Operations Engineer with a strong focus on LAMP/LEMP software stack I finally switched to the DevOps position in 2019 and keep advancing in that direction.

Currently I primarily speciaze in dockerizing microservices and setting up CI/CD process for microserice-based apps.
 
Interested in a collaboration as a Junior Golang Developer / Middle DevOps Engineer
